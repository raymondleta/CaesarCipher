## Description and Usage
This program uses the Caesar Cipher method of encryption to encrypt the messages. The characters in the message are replaced
bynew characters depending on the encryption key entered. The key shifts the characters forward depending on the key number
and replaces the characters with the new characters as specified by the key. The user inputs a message then specifies how 
many positions they would like the characters of their message shifted by, the program then encrypts the message and outputs
the encrypted message. The user can also use the program to decrypt the message by simply inputting the message that was encrypted
the key that was used and pressing enter, the process being the same but this time in reverse.
